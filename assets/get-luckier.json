  "content":"People work hard to chase their dreams. People work harder to bring them into real world. Do you really think it’s luck factor who helps them? If the answer is yes then there’s something that you need to know. If you ask me about luck, I’ll say, when opportunity meets preparedness the connotation of luck comes into existence. In our beautiful world there’s nothing called luck. People work hard. They prepare themselves for opportunities. When they see an opportunity, they put their heart and soul to seize that opportunity. They utilize it and become successful. This is how they get luckier. Everyday we get myriad opportunities but we just let them pass cause we believe that they are not for us. But the fact is that we are not prepared for them. I know this sounds a bit diplomatic but it’s reality. Remember the last time when you got an opportunity and you just let it passed. You’ll see that you let it passed cause you were not ready for it. It’s not your fault. It’s human nature. We human are so obsessed with our comfort zone that whenever we get something for which we are not ready or which is out of our comfort zone, we just raise our hands and let the things go off the table. That’s something makes huge difference between us and successful people. Successful people always keep themselves open. They always keep themseleves ready, if they are not then they prepare for it, but they never let the things go off the table, so the next time when the  “opportunity” comes they can seize it. So work hard, prepare yourself for opportunities and get luckier…"
