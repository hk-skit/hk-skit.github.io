            An engineer wears many hats in his career. Hitesh is not an
            exception. He has also worn many hats. His latest is that of a
            <b>Senior Software Engineer-M2</b> at

          </p>

          <p>
            Hitesh is a big fan of <b>JavaScript</b> and likes everything that
            revolves around it. Currently, he is working with <b>React</b> and
            <b>NodeJs</b>, but he has plenty of experience with
            <b>Angular(Js)</b>, <b>TypeScript</b> and many other cutting-edge
            web technologies including <b>HTML5</b>, <b>CSS3</b>, and
            <b>Canvas</b> 🎨.

          <p>
            Jargons like high-performant, robust, user-friendly, responsive,
            cross-browser compatible, etc. are thrown around when people talk
            about web applications. Hitesh is hooked onto creating these.
          </p>

          <p>
            He has developed, designed and architected many small & large,
            simple & complex web applications from scratch. He has also
            single-handedly written a few UI frameworks to solve
            domain/organization specific problems.
          </p>

          <p>
            <a href="https://www.greytip.com/" target="_blank">Greytip</a>

          <p>
            When Hitesh is tired of breaking and building things, he watches TV
            shows. He also likes to read novels and always carries a book in his
            bag.
          </p>

          <p>
            In his own words, he is a simple soul. Don't forget to
